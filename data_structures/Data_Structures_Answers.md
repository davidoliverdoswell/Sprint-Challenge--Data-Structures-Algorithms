Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?

O(n) - loops through every neighbor to discover each node

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?

O(n) - memory required by the algorithm has same order of magnitude as the
size of the input (number of neighbors).

<!-- 3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
N/A

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
N/A -->

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
O(n log n)  - root to leaf comparison is repeated `n` times

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

O(1) - memory required by the algorithm is constant and does not depend on the
size of the input (items in the list).
